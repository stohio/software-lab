# About the Project
This repository was created to serve as the front end UI for a larger project at Brick Hack 3 on February 12th, 2017. The overall project was designed to help hackathon attendees download software needed to begin their projects at the event. A common problem we saw at hackathons was the large amount of frustration associated with downloading and seting up software like Unity, Android Studio. Most attendees attempt to download these large programs at the start of the event which causes slow, bogged-down WiFi. Our system increased download speeds by at least 10x using our own load balanced, LAN network.

You may view a static version of the site [here](http://stohio.github.io/softwarelab-ui). Keep in mind that downloading files won't work without the backend server running.

The backend repo can be found here: [https://github.com/stohio](https://github.com/stohio)

The project can also be seen on our [Devpost page](https://devpost.com/software/software-lab-table-36).
